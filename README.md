## Overview
"On the Bubble" is a cross-platform student project from [Breda University of Applied Sciences](https://www.buas.nl/en) aiming to create a spiritual successor to the game "Super Monkey Ball". We strive to improve the original by introducing an array of new features that enhance the "Monkey Ball" experience. Our project runs on both PS5 and Windows.

_Note: This is not our working repository due to the non-disclosure nature of PlayStationÂ®5 development. This is only a snippet of the game when we released it._
_Apologies for the lack of visibility of our history, issues and pull-requests._ 

## Features
